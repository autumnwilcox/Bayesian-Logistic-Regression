# Overview
- What is Bayesian Logistic Regression?  
- Why use it for diabetes prediction?  
- How can we apply it to NHANES survey data?  
- What challenges do we face with small samples and missing data?  
- What are our next steps as a team?

# Introduction
- Diabetes is a major global health burden  
- Key risk factors: age, BMI, race, gender  
- Early prediction supports prevention and intervention  
- Classical logistic regression struggles with small samples, missing data, and separation  

---

# Introduction (cont’d)
- Bayesian methods incorporate prior knowledge and quantify uncertainty  
- Useful for complex, noisy, or incomplete health data  
- Strong applications in healthcare (EHR, imaging, surveys)  
- Our project: apply Bayesian logistic regression to NHANES data for diabetes prediction  

---

# Data & Preprocessing
- NHANES survey data (2013–2014)  
- 9,813 observations, 5 selected variables  
- Outcome: diabetes status (0/1)  
- Predictors: BMI, age, gender, race  
- Listwise deletion reduced sample size  
- Multiple imputation used to address missing data  

---

# Methods
- Baseline: classical logistic regression (MLE)  
- Main model: Bayesian logistic regression  
- Priors applied to stabilize estimates  
- Posterior sampling with MCMC  
- Implemented in R (rstanarm / brms)  

---

# Results
- Bayesian model produced stable estimates despite separation issues  
- Posterior distributions provided credible intervals for coefficients  
- Model uncertainty quantified through probability statements  
- Performance compared to baseline logistic regression  

---

# Conclusions
- Bayesian logistic regression improves stability with small or incomplete data  
- Incorporating priors allows better handling of uncertainty  
- NHANES results highlight key predictors of diabetes risk  
- Next steps: refine priors, test model on larger datasets, explore extensions
